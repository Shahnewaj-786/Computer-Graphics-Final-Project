# Computer-Graphics-Final-Project
Design and develop a kid’s application, which is historical place of Bangladesh, The National Martyr’s Memorial.


For making this project we are using C++ programming language and OpenGL.
OpenGL is a cross-language or cross-platform application programming interface for rendering
2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit
(GPU) to achieve hardware rendering. We are using CodeBlocks as our IDE for this project. Our
glut version is 3.7.6 and IDE version is 20.03-mingw. Our project is 2D design-based project,
here we use basic shapes, animations, dynamic color change process, mouse-keyboard controlling process and automatic animation base on time.
Using this project we can create documentation for 26 march or 16 December. 
We use animation which change with time for this we use for loop in our code. 
Our project shows a excellent for loop using method for automatic animation without controlling with maybe key or mouse button. 
We have also key and button feature in our project. So our project shows a great 2D animation knowledge about Computer Graphics and its features.
